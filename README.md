# PRODIGY_CS_02
This is my task number - 2 of my Cyber Security internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

Welcome to the image encryption and decryption program! This Python script allows for secure encryption and decryption of images using bitwise XOR operations. By generating a random key image, the script ensures that your images remain protected and can only be decrypted with the corresponding key.

Features:
* Load and Save Images: Easily load images from your local storage and save the encrypted or decrypted versions.
* Generate Key Image: Create a random key image for secure encryption.
* Encrypt Images: Encrypt your images using the generated key image.
* Decrypt Images: Decrypt your images using the same key image used for encryption.
* User-Friendly Interface: Simple command-line interface to guide you through encryption and decryption processes.
